One day it says they can't find my email, the next I login and change my address and delete the old ones. My next box still goes to the old address. Ok, I go in and see the change didn't take, so I try again. My next box goes to the old address again. I try to login and once again my email is suddenly not valid. I finally chat and they found my account via that exact email. After 3 months of boxes going to an old address I'm not interested in continuing my subscription. Fix your website."

The toys were torn apart in less than 30 seconds and are a bowl obstruction Hazzard. I've requested they cancel the subscription and they refuse. I had to s*** off m6 debit card so they can no longer steal money from me on garbage that will kill my dogs."

10,Stacey T,1 star,12/16/2024,"I've been waiting to hear back from Barbox customer service ever since Dec. 11th. I've been a satisfied customer since the beginning and have never had an issue with my orders until this last one.  I received my monthly box for my pug, however, for this Christmas I decided to purchase a few extra toys for her and followed the packaging shipment with UPS. The issue was that UPS lost my package and stated the only way they can investigate is if the company filed a claim. Therefore, I messaged BarkBox to one of the two contact options they offered on their website, to complain or request assistance with any issues, on the 11th. I followed up by forwarding another message to their second contact information a few days after that, now it's December 16th and have not heard a thing back from them yet and am worried about my pug not being able to get her things on time or if at all."
11,Tonya Z,1 star,12/15/2024,"I started the subscription with the offer for a free double order on my first box which started in October. I then excepted the offer for a discounted double box offer the following month in November. I only received the double box in October. When I spoke with customer service, they told me that I only paid for one double order, in October.. That was my FIRST ORDER ever received, which was supposed to be a FREE DOUBLE BOX that was offered FREE for the FIRST BOX PROMOTION!I then had a manager call me on the phone. The manager told me the same thing! How do you offer a PROMOTIONAL FREE DOUBLE BOX on your first order, but count the FREE DOUBLE PROMOTION as the double order you paid for?!If you have to pay for the first and second double order.. then The FIRST ONE IS NOT FREE!I told the *** to CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION. I am not interested in a company that cannot understand their own concept of a FREE PROMOTIONAL OFFER!!Maybe I'll have better luck with BullyMake!"
12,Porsha H,1 star,12/10/2024,"This is my first time purchasing bark box for my pup for Christmasand sadly disappointed .I purchased a medium dog box ( which only came with only three small dog toys and 2 treats; not worth $37 dollars). Not sure that I will be ordering again, and to add, I was supposed to receive a free upgrade for the first box with 2x toys and treats. Reached customer service and received an automated email requesting to buy another box. Not sure Ill be purchasing again."

23,Melissa H,1 star,12/01/2024,"If I could leave a zero star review I would. I wish I would have done my research on this company before starting services, especially with the legal action against them. My dog cannot consume the treats provided (I ordered allergy which turned out to be different and inedible for her), the quality and quantity of the toys I received are really subpar, I received a duplicate box that I was charged for, and each box was delivered at least a month after I was charged for it (for example, I received the ****** box in September and so on). I asked, ***eatedly and directly, through an ***** chain and in the inquiry page to stop services before November and for a full refund of two boxes at the least. The three customer service ***resentatives aka ""ambassadors"" that I conversed with have refused to cancel my subscription and continued to charge me. Despite half of the items being unusable, receiving a duplicate box, getting every box late, poor quality, and poor communication, the most they offered was to refund the single duplicate box and to send me three, small low-quality toys. They still charged me even with my very reasonable grievances and gave three identical explanations of the 6 month membership, even saying I should switch to toys only! The *** responses were obviously AI. If I had known that they would not honor a customer asking to no longer receive or be charged boxes for a subscription due to the circumstances mentioned above I would have never started the service. It is predatory to force customers into completing a subscription without being transparent about the product/terms and to not honor a request for service end. This is why legal action was taken against them in 2022 with additional litigation. The last *** I messaged with said they follow a Scouts Honor Guarantee, but I doubt that with reviews like these. In the ***s ***** signature they also say ""Obsessed with making pups and their parents happy"". I am just one of very many unhappy customers."
24,Rebecca G,1 star,10/21/2024,It is impossible to cancel your subscription. They have your credit card information and keep charging it even after you cancel. This is a dishonest and very frustrating company. Do not get a bark box subscription! They do not deserve a one star rating.

This is why legal action was taken against them in 2022 with additional litigation. The last *** I messaged with said they follow a Scouts Honor Guarantee, but I doubt that with reviews like these. In the ***s ***** signature they also say ""Obsessed with making pups and their parents happy"". I am just one of very many unhappy customers."
57,Rebecca G,1 star,10/21/2024,It is impossible to cancel your subscription. They have your credit card information and keep charging it even after you cancel. This is a dishonest and very frustrating company. Do not get a bark box subscription! They do not deserve a one star rating.

One day it says they can't find my email, the next I login and change my address and delete the old ones. My next box still goes to the old address. Ok, I go in and see the change didn't take, so I try again. My next box goes to the old address again. I try to login and once again my email is suddenly not valid. I finally chat and they found my account via that exact email. After 3 months of boxes going to an old address I'm not interested in continuing my subscription. Fix your website."

I had to s*** off m6 debit card so they can no longer steal money from me on garbage that will kill my dogs."

I've been a satisfied customer since the beginning and have never had an issue with my orders until this last one.  I received my monthly box for my pug, however, for this Christmas I decided to purchase a few extra toys for her and followed the packaging shipment with UPS. The issue was that UPS lost my package and stated the only way they can investigate is if the company filed a claim. Therefore, I messaged BarkBox to one of the two contact options they offered on their website, to complain or request assistance with any issues, on the 11th. I followed up by forwarding another message to their second contact information a few days after that, now it's December 16th and have not heard a thing back from them yet and am worried about my pug not being able to get her things on time or if at all."
64,Tonya Z,1 star,12/15/2024,"I started the subscription with the offer for a free double order on my first box which started in October. I then excepted the offer for a discounted double box offer the following month in November. I only received the double box in October. When I spoke with customer service, they told me that I only paid for one double order, in October.. That was my FIRST ORDER ever received, which was supposed to be a FREE DOUBLE BOX that was offered FREE for the FIRST BOX PROMOTION!I then had a manager call me on the phone. The manager told me the same thing! How do you offer a PROMOTIONAL FREE DOUBLE BOX on your first order, but count the FREE DOUBLE PROMOTION as the double order you paid for?!If you have to pay for the first and second double order.. then The FIRST ONE IS NOT FREE!I told the *** to CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION. I am not interested in a company that cannot understand their own concept of a FREE PROMOTIONAL OFFER!!Maybe I'll have better luck with BullyMake!"

I asked, ***eatedly and directly, through an ***** chain and in the inquiry page to stop services before November and for a full refund of two boxes at the least. The three customer service ***resentatives aka ""ambassadors"" that I conversed with have refused to cancel my subscription and continued to charge me. Despite half of the items being unusable, receiving a duplicate box, getting every box late, poor quality, and poor communication, the most they offered was to refund the single duplicate box and to send me three, small low-quality toys. They still charged me even with my very reasonable grievances and gave three identical explanations of the 6 month membership, even saying I should switch to toys only! The *** responses were obviously AI. If I had known that they would not honor a customer asking to no longer receive or be charged boxes for a subscription due to the circumstances mentioned above I would have never started the service. It is predatory to force customers into completing a subscription without being transparent about the product/terms and to not honor a request for service end. This is why legal action was taken against them in 2022 with additional litigation. The last *** I messaged with said they follow a Scouts Honor Guarantee, but I doubt that with reviews like these. In the ***s ***** signature they also say ""Obsessed with making pups and their parents happy"". I am just one of very many unhappy customers."
112,Rebecca G,1 star,10/21/2024,It is impossible to cancel your subscription. They have your credit card information and keep charging it even after you cancel. This is a dishonest and very frustrating company. Do not get a bark box subscription! They do not deserve a one star rating.
113,Heather  J,1 star,07/26/2022,"I asked Bark Box to delete my account and associated data and I was told ""Unfortunately, your state of residence does not afford you the right to make this request."" When I pressed further, they refused to simply delete my account."
114,Ariel Y,1 star,07/23/2022,"As of writing this (07/22/22) I made an account (12 months) for my pup. After some steps, they give you an option to waive the shipping fee for an additional $9 fee add on item. I decided to pick the bright dental chews. Everything was fine and dandy, however I decided to scroll around on their platform and accidentally hit the delete button on my add on item. No big deal right? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I contacted customer support on the web chat and asked them to add back on my item for the reoccurring payment of $9. I tried looking for the item and only saw the same item listed on the add-on option for $25 instead of $9 in the start of making my account. The customer service agent Brylle said that they do not have the item available for me. How is that possible? Youre selling the same item for $25, why the price discrepancy? Was there a difference between the start of my account until now (as a member)? My account at this point has only been 5 mins old. At this point, with all this unlawful advertising and fraudulent behavior for a new customer I want out of this subscription. The customer service teams are unwilling to work with you. When I exited out of the webpage with the chat still enabled Brylle decided to end the chat abruptly wiping the chat log and the second customer service member **** said Brylle sent an email to reconnect, which is false once again because I received no email of Brylle reaching out to me about the disconnection. I have never been so excited and disappointed with a companys behavior in the 30 literal minute timeframe as Barkbox have inflicted on me. PLEASE AVOID!"
115,Thomas L,1 star,03/18/2025,"After attempting to change my address multiple times and having issues with logging into my account. One day it says they can't find my email, the next I login and change my address and delete the old ones. My next box still goes to the old address. Ok, I go in and see the change didn't take, so I try again. My next box goes to the old address again. I try to login and once again my email is suddenly not valid. I finally chat and they found my account via that exact email. After 3 months of boxes going to an old address I'm not interested in continuing my subscription. Fix your website."
116,Samantha H,1 star,02/10/2025,Horrible customer service ***** I have been trying to cancel and no response or no help at all talked to 5 different ppl and they haven't cancelled my subscriptions at all they are more fraudulent than any other company
117,Tammi G,1 star,02/10/2025,"They say if you need to contact them it has to me through email, text or FB messenger, then they do not respond.I bought a subscription for 2 tecue puppies. The toys were torn apart in less than 30 seconds and are a bowl obstruction Hazzard. I've requested they cancel the subscription and they refuse. I had to s*** off m6 debit card so they can no longer steal money from me on garbage that will kill my dogs."
118,Scott H,1 star,02/05/2025,"I have had a couple of years of the subscription and thought I could get out, but no.They don't notify you that your subscriptions is renewing and now I'm stuck with another year of this that I don't want."
119,Kim F,1 star,01/16/2025,I am having a horrible time getting a response from this company to cancel a subscription. I have sent 5 emails with no response.  No phone number to call.
120,Stacey T,1 star,12/16/2024,"I've been waiting to hear back from Barbox customer service ever since Dec. 11th. I've been a satisfied customer since the beginning and have never had an issue with my orders until this last one.  I received my monthly box for my pug, however, for this Christmas I decided to purchase a few extra toys for her and followed the packaging shipment with UPS. The issue was that UPS lost my package and stated the only way they can investigate is if the company filed a claim. Therefore, I messaged BarkBox to one of the two contact options they offered on their website, to complain or request assistance with any issues, on the 11th. I followed up by forwarding another message to their second contact information a few days after that, now it's December 16th and have not heard a thing back from them yet and am worried about my pug not being able to get her things on time or if at all."
121,Tonya Z,1 star,12/15/2024,"I started the subscription with the offer for a free double order on my first box which started in October. I then excepted the offer for a discounted double box offer the following month in November. I only received the double box in October. When I spoke with customer service, they told me that I only paid for one double order, in October.. That was my FIRST ORDER ever received, which was supposed to be a FREE DOUBLE BOX that was offered FREE for the FIRST BOX PROMOTION!I then had a manager call me on the phone. The manager told me the same thing! How do you offer a PROMOTIONAL FREE DOUBLE BOX on your first order, but count the FREE DOUBLE PROMOTION as the double order you paid for?!If you have to pay for the first and second double order.. then The FIRST ONE IS NOT FREE!I told the *** to CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION. I am not interested in a company that cannot understand their own concept of a FREE PROMOTIONAL OFFER!!Maybe I'll have better luck with BullyMake!"
122,Porsha H,1 star,12/10/2024,"This is my first time purchasing bark box for my pup for Christmasand sadly disappointed .I purchased a medium dog box ( which only came with only three small dog toys and 2 treats; not worth $37 dollars). Not sure that I will be ordering again, and to add, I was supposed to receive a free upgrade for the first box with 2x toys and treats. Reached customer service and received an automated email requesting to buy another box. Not sure Ill be purchasing again."
123,Andrea B,1 star,12/05/2024,I have been trying for days to get ahold of someone. I purchased a 1 time 6 month subscription as a gift and they have reviewed it multiple times and without anywhere to manage it.
